# LLMs as Operating Systems: Agent Memory

This repository explores how to build and operate memory-managed agents using **MemGPT**. The project is based on the **LLMs as Operating Systems: Agent Memory** course, diving into core concepts and applications of memory in agent systems.

## Key Concepts

- **Editable Memory**: Understand and manage dynamic memory for agents.
- **MemGPT Foundations**: Learn the architecture of memory-augmented agents.
- **Agent Memory Programming**: Implement memory management for autonomous behavior.
- **Agentic RAG & External Memory**: Combine memory with retrieval-augmented generation.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple memory-equipped agents.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Python and LLMs.
- Understanding of basic agent architecture.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install any dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Explore sample implementations for building memory-aware agents.
